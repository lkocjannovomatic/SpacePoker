1. Communication with the `godot-llm` addon will be centralized in a single `LLMClient.gd` script, configured as an autoload singleton.
2. Asynchronous communication will be handled via signals to prevent the UI from blocking, and a loading indicator will be displayed during LLM processing.
3. Error handling will be managed within the `LLMClient.gd` wrapper, which will emit a custom `error_occurred` signal for the UI to handle.
4. A minimal test scene, `SpikeTest.tscn`, will be created with a `LineEdit` for input, a `Button` to send, and a `RichTextLabel` for output.
5. The success of the technical spike will be judged by the ability to send text, receive a response, ensure the UI remains responsive, and gracefully handle errors.
6. The code developed for the spike, specifically `LLMClient.gd`, will be structured for reusability in the final application.

<matched_recommendations>
1. **Centralized Wrapper:** Create a wrapper script, `LLMClient.gd`, as an autoload singleton to be the sole point of contact with the addon.
2. **Asynchronous Handling:** Use signals (`response_received`) from `LLMClient.gd` to notify the UI of a completed request, and display a loading indicator while waiting.
3. **Error Signaling:** The `LLMClient.gd` wrapper should define and emit a custom `error_occurred(message)` signal to report errors from the addon or LLM.
4. **Minimal UI:** Create a single scene (`SpikeTest.tscn`) with a `LineEdit`, `Button`, and `RichTextLabel` for a basic request/response interface.
5. **Success Criteria:** Define success as: successful text-in/text-out, a non-blocking UI, and a visible error message on a simulated failure.
6. **Reusable Code:** Implement `LLMClient.gd` as an autoload singleton from the start so it can be used by the rest of the project later without modification.

<technical_spike_summary>
The technical spike project is designed to validate the core functionality of integrating a local LLM with the Godot engine using the `godot-llm` addon.

**Main Requirements:**
The primary goal is to create a minimal, non-blocking prototype that can send a text prompt to the local LLM and display its response. The prototype must include robust error handling to manage potential failures in the addon or the LLM itself. The resulting code should be modular and reusable for the final game.

**Key Scripts and Scenes:**
- **`LLMClient.gd`:** An autoload singleton script that will act as a dedicated wrapper for the `godot-llm` addon. It will abstract the complexities of the addon, providing a simple API to the rest of the application. It will manage asynchronous requests and emit signals for success (`response_received`) and failure (`error_occurred`).
- **`SpikeTest.tscn`:** A single, disposable scene for testing. It will contain the necessary UI elements.
- **`SpikeTest.gd`:** The script attached to the `SpikeTest.tscn` scene. It will handle UI logic, such as getting text from a `LineEdit`, calling the `LLMClient.gd` singleton on a `Button` press, showing/hiding a loading indicator, and updating a `RichTextLabel` with the response or error by connecting to the signals from `LLMClient.gd`.

**Relationships:**
The `SpikeTest.gd` script will have a direct dependency on the `LLMClient.gd` singleton. It will call functions on the singleton to initiate requests and will listen for its signals to update the UI. `LLMClient.gd` will encapsulate all direct interaction with the `godot-llm` addon.
