# SpacePoker

A single-player, offline desktop poker game (No-Limit Texas Hold'em) with LLM-powered NPCs. The core innovation is creating opponents with unique, LLM-generated backstories that inform a set of personality traits. These traits, in turn, influence a rule-based game strategy, making each opponent's playstyle distinct. Players can also engage in real-time conversations with the NPCs, whose dialogue is generated by a local LLM guided by their established personality.

This project serves as an educational tool to gain hands-on experience in integrating LLM technology into a functional application.

## Tech Stack
- **Game Engine:** [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)
- **LLM Integration:** [Godot LLM Addon](https://github.com/Adriankhl/godot-llm)
- **Language Model:** Local Phi-3-mini LLM

## Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites
- A recent stable version of the Godot Engine.
- A GGUF-compatible LLM model file. The project is configured for `Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-q4.gguf`.

### Installation & Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd SpacePoker
    ```
2.  **Download the Language Model:**
    - Obtain the `Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-q4.gguf` model. You can find quantized models on platforms like Hugging Face.
    - Place the downloaded model file inside the `llms/` directory in the project root and rename it to llm.gguf.

3.  **Run the project:**
    - Open the Godot Engine editor.
    - Click "Import" and select the `project.godot` file from the cloned repository.
    - Once the project is loaded, click the "Play" button (or press F5) to run the game.

## Project Structure
The project follows a standard Godot project structure:
```

└── project.godot       # The main Godot project file
```

## Project Scope

### In Scope (MVP)
- A fully functional, single-player, offline desktop application for Windows.
- Implementation of one poker variant: No-Limit Texas Hold'em.
- A maximum of 8 generated NPC opponents.
- NPC personality driven by three specific factors (`aggression`, `bluffing`, `risk_aversion`).
- Real-time chat with NPCs powered by a local LLM.
- Persistence of NPC profiles, statistics, and conversation summaries in local JSON files.

### Out of Scope (MVP)
- Web, mobile, or console versions.
- Online or local multiplayer functionality.
- User accounts, authentication, or cloud-based saves.
- Saving or loading a game that is in progress.
- Dynamic or increasing blind levels.
- AI-powered generation of visual assets.

## Project Status
This project is currently **in development**. The primary goal is educational, focusing on the successful integration of LLM technology within the Godot game engine.
