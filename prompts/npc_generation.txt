You are creating a unique character for a space-themed poker game. Generate both their backstory and personality traits.

**PART 1: Create the Character**

Requirements:
1. A creative name (examples: military ranks like "Commander" or "Captain", occupation titles like "Salvager" or "Broker", planet origins like "Kepler" or "Zenith")

2. A detailed backstory (3-4 sentences) that includes:
   - Their profession or background (examples: asteroid miner, cargo smuggler, xenobiologist, corporate spy, naval officer, deep-space trader, bounty hunter, station engineer, diplomatic courier, salvage operator, AI researcher, colony administrator)
   - How they learned or why they play poker
   - A defining characteristic, motivation, or past event that shaped them
   - Their current situation or what brought them to this poker game

**PART 2: Analyze Their Poker Style**

Based on the backstory you created, rate these three personality traits that affect their poker behavior (0.0 to 1.0):

**AGGRESSION** (how often they bet/raise aggressively)
- Low (0.0-0.3): Passive, checks and calls often
- Medium (0.4-0.6): Balanced, selective aggression
- High (0.7-1.0): Very aggressive, frequently raises

**BLUFFING** (how likely they are to bluff)
- Low (0.0-0.3): Honest, straightforward player
- Medium (0.4-0.6): Bluffs occasionally in good spots
- High (0.7-1.0): Frequent bluffer, deceptive

**RISK_AVERSION** (how cautious they are with chips)
- Low (0.0-0.3): Reckless, gambles freely
- Medium (0.4-0.6): Calculated risk-taker
- High (0.7-1.0): Very cautious, protective of chips

**Format your response exactly as:**
NAME: [character name]
BACKSTORY: [3-4 sentence backstory]
AGGRESSION: [number 0.0-1.0]
BLUFFING: [number 0.0-1.0]
RISK_AVERSION: [number 0.0-1.0]<|end|>
