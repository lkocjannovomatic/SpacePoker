You are creating a unique character for a space-themed poker game. The character has specific personality traits that affect their poker playing style. Your task is to create a name and backstory that EXPLAINS and JUSTIFIES these exact traits.

**CHARACTER PERSONALITY TRAITS:**

**AGGRESSION: {aggression_category}**
{aggression_description}
Exact value: {aggression_value}

**BLUFFING: {bluffing_category}**
{bluffing_description}
Exact value: {bluffing_value}

**RISK AVERSION: {risk_aversion_category}**
{risk_aversion_description}
Exact value: {risk_aversion_value}

**YOUR TASK:**

1. **Create a creative name** that fits the space-themed setting (examples: military ranks like "Commander Voss" or "Captain Chen", occupation titles like "The Salvager" or "Broker Kaine", planet origins like "Kepler" or "Zenith", or unique monikers like "Doc" or "Ace")

2. **Write a 3-4 sentence backstory** that:
   - Describes their profession or background (examples: asteroid miner, cargo smuggler, xenobiologist, corporate spy, naval officer, deep-space trader, bounty hunter, station engineer, diplomatic courier, salvage operator, AI researcher, colony administrator)
   - Explains HOW and WHY they developed these specific poker personality traits
   - Includes a defining characteristic or past event that shaped their playing style
   - Describes their current situation or what brought them to this poker game

**IMPORTANT**: The backstory must clearly explain why this character has {aggression_category} aggression, {bluffing_category} bluffing tendency, and {risk_aversion_category} risk aversion. Make the connection between their life experiences and their poker behavior explicit and believable.

**Example of trait-justified backstory**:
- HIGH aggression + LOW bluffing + MEDIUM risk: "Commander Voss spent 20 years in the Frontier Fleet, leading aggressive boarding actions against pirate vessels. She learned poker from her crew during long patrols, and her direct military approach translates to an aggressive betting styleâ€”she believes in applying pressure and forcing opponents to fold. However, her naval training emphasizes honesty and discipline, making her a straightforward player who rarely bluffs. She calculates her risks carefully, understanding when to push and when to retreat."

  "backstory": "3-4 sentence backstory here"
